Codecademy's "Build Websites from Scratch" PRO Intensive's Capstone Project
I used a monochromatic palette of colors from Paletton.com for my design, and I purposely changed the margins/paddings of a couple of elements because I thought it would strengthen the design. I also added 2 breaking points instead of 1, because while vivisting the website on my mobile phone, I realized it didn't look perfect on landscape mode, so I changed a few rules for screens between normal desktop/laptops, and mobiles on portrait mode. I finished this Capstone project before moving on with the rest of Unit 8, so I didn't get to, nor added, any information from lessons on 'Font Awesome' and 'Managing Assets and Icons' (Althought not required for the Capstone project, I wanted my reviewer to know).
