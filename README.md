Codecademy's "Build Websites from Scratch" PRO Intensive's Capstone Project.

I used a monochromatic palette of colors from Paletton.com for my design, and I purposely changed the margins/paddings of a couple of elements because I thought it would strengthen the design. I also added 2 breaking points instead of 1, because while visting the website on my mobile phone, I realized it didn't look perfect on landscape mode, so I changed a few rules for screens between normal desktop/laptops, and mobiles on portrait mode.
